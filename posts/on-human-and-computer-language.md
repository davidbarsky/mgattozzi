# On Human and Computer Language
<div class="subtitle">Published September , 2017</div>

Back in High School I hated learning languages. Latin, a dead language in this
day and age, was a required subject and I had to take a modern language as well.
Needless to say it was a pain to learn, I was confused, and I didn't do well at
all. I mean F's and summer school bad. Not one of my proudest academic
achievements for sure. However, I know quite a few programming languages, and
I can easily pick up the basics of a new one given a weekend or two. Rust was
the exception, but I'm glad I've stuck with it. I've been wondering why I found
this kind of language was easier to pick up then say Latin and Italian for me at
school.

Recently I've been learning Japanese. I know, it's like Dark Souls for English
speakers, but I've been finding it intuitive to learn and fun. I've been
pondering as to why this is as well. Part of it I think is because I want too (I
love anime if you didn't know, just look at my recent [RustConf talk]()), but
also because of the way I've been learning it which feels more like learning
a new programming language for me. Let me explain.

## Feedback Loops and Errors

I've been doing a lot of my Japanese study with [Duolingo]() and [Memrise]() and
only recently have I started supplementing it with flashcards and textbooks
which are traditionally how most people learn a language here in America. I've
found this route to be similar to how I'll learn a new programming language. Try
something out with only the bare minimum knowledge needed, fail, get feedback
from the error messages, fix it, rinse and repeat.

## Terseness and Language Shortcuts

As an example say I was trying to learn Javascript for the first time. I might
try something like this to learn variable assignment:

```js
var a = 1;
var b = 2;

console.log(a + b);
```

It's a short example but it illustrates me the underlying concept of any
programming language, you can assign values to variables, do something with
them, and display them. These are universal concepts in programming. How it's
done in each one is different but it's there.

What does this have to do with human languages though? Let's look at how to say
one's name in Japanese:

```
ぼくはマイケルです = Boku wa Maikeru desu = I am Mike.
```

This is textbook Japanese and not how one would actually speak it, but it
illustrates the same concept. Names are a universal thing in languages so
learning how to say one's name is a simple way to start learning a language.
Now, what if we took both of the examples above and made them better and more
like what we'd expect in each of these languages:

```js
var a = 3;
console.log(a);
```

```
マイケルです = Maikeru desu = I am Mike.
```

Both are a bit more terse but do the same thing. Both are still correct but in
a way they're more like how we would actually speak or write it. As we learn new
programming languages we over time learn better patterns, more terse ways to
express ourselves, and find out the colloquial way to express our ideas in the
code. In much the same way, learning another spoken language, we pick up on
idioms, common ways to say things, and how to contract and transmit words in
a more compacted manner. In the above example This is how most people
introducing themselves in Japan would if they want to use keigo which is the
polite form which most courses teach, but they don't teach the casual form
used amongst friends and family which I think is a mistake, but I digress.
I only learned that after listening to videos from native speakers and them
explaining that to English speakers! In much the same way you only learn the
more terse patterns and expected patterns by interacting with the community of
the language you are learning.

## Different Words Same Idea

I've always liked that programming languages can express the same exact program,
using the same language, in different ways. I think we like to look at
programming as this mathematically rigid thing but it's fluid and nuanced, much
like spoken language. I can express the same idea in multiple different ways in
English (and as I learn more, Japanese), and still get the same outcome. Some
ways will sound better, some more terse, or in others more clean or beautiful.
It's all subjective and some ways of communicating are better but the outcome is
the same in that the idea it expresses is somehow encoded. I think that's really
neat. I think this comes from the fact that programming languages are for
humans, by humans, that just happen to need to be interpreted by
computers.
